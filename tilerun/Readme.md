**GOAL OF THE GAME**

The goal of "Tilerun" is to finish the obstacle course as soon as possible whilst collecting coins. The coins will reward in a decrease of time, which will lead to a better chance of reaching the highschore.

**WALKTHROUGH**

As you begin, the player will be able to pick between 3 characters. First there will be an instruction screen explaining the controls. Which will be followed by the actual gameplay of 3 (2 game levels and 1 introduction level) levels. When the end point is reached, the player will be redirected to the score calculation and highscore viewer. But, be careful! You don't want to fall off.

**CODE**

I have looked on the internet for help. Especially to program the sprite-map collision. I was able to get some information, but the could was written all by me. Nothing has been copied from the internet or other external sources.

**MEDIA SOURCES**

For the artwork of the sprites, backgrounds and sounds, a .txt file will be included. I did get one sound from YouTube, but since this is a school project (not something i would want to use for other purposes), i didn't really notice any harm.

**DEMO GAMEPLAY**

As some levels are harder to complete, i included a .mkv file with a video of me completing the game.
